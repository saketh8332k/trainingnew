first we need to link our git to the vs-code
then local repo is divided into 2 types
i)un-tracked files
  -create
  -update
  -delete
ii)trakced files
   -git add file-name(only for specific file)
   -git add.(all the files in the folder)
   -git commit -m "message"
These commands are used to convert the untracked files to tracked files.

-After converting we need to send from local repo to the git-hub
-In the git-hub we need to create a repository
-To add the http path generated by the repo we need to give command "git remote add origin http-path"
-To add all the tracked files to the repo we need to use the command "git push -u main/master"(u=unstreamed)
